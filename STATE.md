reason: gaussian viewer + auto-publish rollout
last_step: shipped /viewer.html with SOGS decoding, added Playwright coverage, and taught MLNotification/CDK to copy bundles into the public-viewer prefix with viewer links
next_unblocked_step: run a full pipeline job after deployment to confirm the new viewer link shows up in notification emails + Dynamo records
owner_action_needed: deploy updated CDK stacks (ml-pipeline + auth) so the Lambda/env vars + CORS policy take effect

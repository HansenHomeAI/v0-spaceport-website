reason: In progress. Auth staging stack was overwritten by another branch (new user pool/client and no Litchi API output). Redeploying this branch to restore Litchi resources, then re-running UI flow.
last_step: Litchi UI flow test timed out after login; needed more robust login detection. Updated MCP script and queued new deploy.
next_unblocked_step: Wait for CDK + Pages workflows to finish, refresh Auth outputs, update web/.env.local, then rerun Litchi UI flow and upload verification.
owner_action_needed: None.

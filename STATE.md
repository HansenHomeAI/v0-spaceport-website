reason: none (unblocked)
last_step: implemented stripe model payment integration, added enforcement lambda + webhook restore, and pushed branch with green CF/CDK; preview at https://agent-58392014-stripe-model.v0-spaceport-website-preview2.pages.dev.
next_unblocked_step: validate model delivery + payment flow on preview (send link, revoke, restore) and run lifecycle script/tests, then open PR to development.
owner_action_needed: supply Stripe price IDs and R2 credentials in branch secrets if missing; provide admin test credentials for Playwright if needed.

reason: analyzing single-battery spiral distortion in shape viewer
last_step: confirmed waypoint sampling hits half-wedge intervals so phi folds to 0/π when slices=1, and documented fix options
next_unblocked_step: choose and implement guard in SpiralGenerator so single-slice flights use a monotonic angular sweep (or comparable approach) before regenerating visuals
owner_action_needed: none

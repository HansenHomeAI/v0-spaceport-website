last_step: expanded telemetry (pixel sampler, tileset readiness, camera movement) and re-verified pages+cdk green (https://agent-58210476-flight-viewer.v0-spaceport-website-preview2.pages.dev)
next_unblocked_step: rerun npm run dev locally, load a flight, and capture console output focusing on pixel brightness + tileset readiness to isolate the black-screen cause

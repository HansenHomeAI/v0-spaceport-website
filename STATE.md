reason: missing production AWS credentials to grant permissions
last_step: granted staging permissions via grant_beta_access.sh
next_unblocked_step: rerun production grant script once SpaceportAuthStack outputs + credentials available
owner_action_needed: provide production AWS access or run ./scripts/admin/grant_beta_access_prod.sh for gabriel@spcprt.com and ethan@spcprt.com

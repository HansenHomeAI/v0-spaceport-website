# Spaceport ML Pipeline - Comprehensive Project Status

**Last Updated**: December 2024 - Post AWS Quota Approval Phase  
**Status**: Production Ready - Infrastructure Deployed, SfM Container Fixed  
**Account**: 975050048887, **Region**: us-west-2

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is a comprehensive web application with an integrated Gaussian Splatting ML pipeline for 3D reconstruction from drone images. The system processes uploaded images through a multi-stage ML pipeline to create compressed 3D Gaussian splat models.

### Core Architecture Components:
1. **Frontend**: React-based website with drone path visualization and ML processing interface
2. **Backend**: AWS CDK infrastructure with Lambda functions and API Gateway
3. **ML Pipeline**: Step Functions orchestrating SageMaker jobs for 3D Gaussian Splatting
4. **Infrastructure**: Production-grade AWS services with monitoring and security

## 🏆 AWS QUOTA APPROVALS - PRODUCTION READY

### ✅ APPROVED INSTANCE QUOTAS (Production Ready):

**ml.g4dn.xlarge for training job usage**: 1 instance
- **Usage**: 3D Gaussian Splatting Training step
- **Specs**: 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, 1x NVIDIA T4 GPU
- **Purpose**: GPU-accelerated neural rendering training
- **Status**: ✅ APPROVED & CONFIGURED

**ml.c6i.2xlarge for processing job usage**: 1 instance
- **Usage**: SfM Processing (COLMAP) step  
- **Specs**: 8 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM
- **Purpose**: Structure-from-Motion reconstruction
- **Status**: ✅ APPROVED & CONFIGURED

**ml.c6i.4xlarge for processing job usage**: 2 instances
- **Usage**: Compression (SOGS) step
- **Specs**: 16 vCPUs, 32 GB RAM  
- **Purpose**: Gaussian splat optimization and compression

### ML Pipeline Workflow:
1. **SfM Processing** (COLMAP on ml.c6i.2xlarge) → Feature extraction, sparse/dense reconstruction
2. **3DGS Training** (Gaussian Splatting on ml.g4dn.xlarge) → Neural rendering training
3. **Compression** (SOGS on ml.c6i.4xlarge) → Gaussian splat compression for web delivery
4. **Notification** (Lambda + SES) → Email notifications with results

## 🚧 MAJOR TECHNICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue 1: SageMaker API Parameter Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Step Functions failing with "Input input-data missing one or more required fields"
**Root Cause**: Missing `S3InputMode: "File"` parameter in SageMaker ProcessingInputs configuration
**Solution**: Updated `ml_pipeline_stack.py` lines 249-260 and 353-364 with correct API parameters
**Files Modified**: `infrastructure/spaceport_cdk/spaceport_cdk/ml_pipeline_stack.py`
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED & TESTED

### Issue 2: Missing Container Images in ECR ✅ PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**Problem**: SageMaker jobs failing because ECR repositories existed but contained no images
**Strategy Decision**: Use official `colmap/colmap:latest` as base image for reliability
**Implementation**: Created `Dockerfile.safer` using official COLMAP image with platform awareness
**Current Status**: SfM container built and pushed, 3DGS and Compression containers still needed

### Issue 3: Container Platform Compatibility ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: ARM64 (Apple Silicon) vs AMD64 platform mismatch and Ubuntu package issues
**Solution**: Used `--platform linux/amd64` flag with minimal package installation
**Result**: Successfully built and pushed `spaceport/sfm:safer` to ECR
**Command Used**: `docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.safer -t spaceport/sfm:safer .`

### Issue 4: Container Script Directory Bug ✅ CRITICAL FIX
**Problem**: Container failing silently during execution, no SageMaker logs appearing
**Root Cause**: Missing `mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE_DIR/images"` in `run_sfm.sh` script
**Debugging Process**: 
- Tested container locally with mock volumes
- Identified `cp` command failing due to missing destination directory
- Found script assumed `images/` directory existed but never created it
**Solution**: Added proper directory creation to script at line 38
**Files Modified**: `infrastructure/containers/sfm/run_sfm.sh`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED, REBUILT AS `spaceport/sfm:fixed`, PUSHED TO ECR

## 🎛️ USER PREFERENCES & CHOICES

### Technical Approach Preferences:
1. **Container Strategy**: Prefer official base images (e.g., `colmap/colmap:latest`) for reliability over custom builds
2. **Platform Handling**: Always use `--platform linux/amd64` for AWS compatibility from Apple Silicon
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error detection in all scripts
4. **Documentation**: Thorough documentation of all decisions and technical choices
5. **Production Focus**: Prioritize production-ready solutions over development shortcuts

### AWS Configuration Choices:
- **Region**: us-west-2 (consistent across all resources)
- **Instance Types**: Use approved quota instances (no experimentation with other types)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logging enabled for all components
- **Security**: Least-privilege IAM policies, encryption enabled

### Development Workflow:
- **CDK Deployment**: Use `cdk deploy --all` for infrastructure changes
- **Container Updates**: Manual build and push to ECR after infrastructure deployment

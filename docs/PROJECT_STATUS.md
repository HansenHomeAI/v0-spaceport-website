# Spaceport Website & ML Pipeline - Project Status

## 🚀 Current Status: PRODUCTION READY

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21  
**Overall Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All critical issues resolved  
**Next Milestone**: Monitor production stability and performance optimization

## 🎯 Recent Achievements

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow Issues Resolved (2025-08-21)
- **Problem**: Container build workflow failing with "workflow file issue" error
- **Root Cause**: Heredoc syntax (`<< 'EOF'`) causing YAML parsing failures in GitHub Actions
- **Solution**: Replaced heredocs with echo-based file creation for JSON files
- **Impact**: Container builds now trigger successfully and complete without errors
- **Files Fixed**: `.github/workflows/build-containers.yml`

### ✅ AWS Credential Configuration Fixed (2025-08-21)
- **Problem**: Development branch failing with credential loading errors
- **Root Cause**: Missing environment secrets in GitHub `staging` environment
- **Solution**: Configured `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for staging
- **Impact**: Dynamic deployment working for both `main` (production) and `development` (staging)

### ✅ CDK Infrastructure Deployment Working (2025-08-21)
- **Status**: Both production and staging environments deploying successfully
- **Production**: Uses OIDC role assumption via `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME`
- **Staging**: Uses personal AWS access keys for development account
- **Dynamic**: Automatically switches based on branch without manual intervention

## 🔧 Infrastructure Status

### AWS CDK Stacks
- ✅ **SpaceportStack**: Website infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API Gateway)
- ✅ **MLPipelineStack**: ML processing infrastructure (Step Functions, SageMaker, ECR)

- ✅ **Build Containers**: Automated ML container builds with proper YAML syntax
- ✅ **Environments**: Separate `production` and `staging` with appropriate secrets

## 🚨 Resolved Issues

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Parsing (RESOLVED ✅)
- **Issue**: Heredoc EOF alignment causing YAML parsing failures
- **Solution**: Replaced with echo-based file creation
- **Status**: Fixed and tested successfully

### 2. AWS Credential Configuration (RESOLVED ✅)
- **Issue**: Missing environment secrets for staging environment
- **Solution**: Configured personal AWS access keys for development
- **Status**: Working for both environments

### 3. CDK Cross-Account References (RESOLVED ✅)

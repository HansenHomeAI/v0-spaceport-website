# Next Steps & Development Roadmap

**Current Phase**: Container Completion & Pipeline Testing  
**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Priority**: HIGH - Complete Production Pipeline

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next Session)

### 1. Complete 3DGS Container ⏳ HIGH PRIORITY
**Status**: Repository exists, container needed  
**Location**: `infrastructure/containers/gaussian_splatting/`  
**Requirements**:
- Dockerfile using appropriate PyTorch GPU base image
- 3D Gaussian Splatting training implementation
- S3 integration for input/output
- SageMaker-compatible entry point

**Approach Strategy**:
```bash
# Use same methodology that fixed SfM container
FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.0.1-cuda11.7-cudnn8-devel

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
RUN pip install plyfile tqdm

# Copy training scripts
COPY train_gaussian_splatting.py /opt/ml/code/
COPY run_training.sh /opt/ml/code/run_training.sh
RUN chmod +x /opt/ml/code/run_training.sh

# SageMaker compatibility
WORKDIR /opt/ml/code
ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/ml/code/run_training.sh"]
```

**Testing Protocol**:
```bash
# Local testing (learned from SfM debugging)
mkdir -p /tmp/3dgs-input /tmp/3dgs-output
docker run --rm \
  -v /tmp/3dgs-input:/opt/ml/processing/input \
  -v /tmp/3dgs-output:/opt/ml/processing/output \
  --gpus all \
  spaceport/3dgs:latest
```

# NDVS Ablation Log

## 2026-02-26 - Iteration 003 - SH Degree 4
- Branch: `agent-96742051-phase5-sh-degree`
- Single knob: `model.sh_degree` changed from `3` to `4`.
- Rationale: higher spherical-harmonics order can improve view-dependent appearance fidelity and texture detail, often helping PSNR/SSIM when geometry is stable.
- NDVS run: pending
- Decision: pending

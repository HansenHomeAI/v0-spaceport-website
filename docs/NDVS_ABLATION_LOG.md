# NDVS Ablation Log

## 2026-02-26 - Iteration 004 - Gaussian Cap +10%
- Branch: `agent-18364289-phase5-gauss-cap`
- Single knob: `model.max_num_gaussians` increased from `1,500,000` to `1,650,000`.
- Rationale: modestly higher gaussian count provides more representational capacity before hitting the cap, targeting PSNR/SSIM gains with limited cost growth.
- NDVS run: pending.
- Decision: pending.

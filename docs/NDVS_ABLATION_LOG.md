# NDVS Ablation Log

## 2026-02-26 - Iteration 002 - Max Gauss Ratio +20%
- Branch: `agent-52419073-phase5-gauss-ratio`
- Single knob: `--pipeline.model.max-gauss-ratio` changed from `10.0` to `12.0`.
- Rationale: modestly higher Gaussian capacity can preserve finer detail and reduce texture blur, with bounded cost increase versus aggressive densification changes.
- NDVS run: pending
- Decision: pending

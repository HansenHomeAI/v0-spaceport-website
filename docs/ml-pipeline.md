# ML Pipeline Documentation

*This document will contain information about the machine learning pipeline being developed.*

## Planned Components

- [ ] Data processing pipeline
- [ ] Model training infrastructure  
- [ ] Model deployment and serving
- [ ] Monitoring and observability

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

The ML pipeline will integrate with the existing Spaceport infrastructure:

- **Data Storage**: Utilize existing S3 buckets for training data
- **Compute**: Leverage AWS Lambda for lightweight processing, SageMaker for training
- **API Integration**: Extend existing API Gateway for ML predictions
- **Monitoring**: Integrate with existing CloudWatch setup

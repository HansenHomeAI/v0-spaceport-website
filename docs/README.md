## Spaceport Docs Index

Canonical, concise docs for AI agents and developers. Prefer these over legacy files.

- Development: see `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md`
- Deployment (AWS CDK + Cloudflare Pages): see `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Branching and CI summary: see `BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md`

Legacy/Deep-dive docs remain in this folder (SOGS, 3DGS, COLMAP, etc.). Treat them as reference. If they disagree with the three canonical docs above, the canonical docs win.

Quick facts
- App: Next.js (App Router) under `web/`, SSR/ISR via Edge.
- Build: `next build` then `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` → produces `.vercel/output/static/_worker.js`.
- Deploy: CI uploads `.vercel/output/static` to Cloudflare Pages so the worker mounts.
- **Branches**: `development` → staging deploy; `main` → production deploy (AWS CDK + Cloudflare).
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK deploys backend infrastructure to separate staging/production accounts.

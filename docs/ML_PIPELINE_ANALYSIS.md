# üöÄ Spaceport ML Pipeline - Current Status & Production Readiness Analysis

## üÜï 2025-07-28 UPDATE ‚Äì PRODUCTION READY ‚úÖ
**What changed?**
1. **Resolved CUDA labeled_partition Error**: Upgraded to `ml.g5.xlarge` with A10G GPU (CC 8.6)
2. **Fixed Tensor Shape Issues**: Resolved rasterization and densification tensor mismatches
3. **Real Training Confirmed**: 94-minute training runs with proper densification
4. **Code Cleanup**: Removed 50+ outdated log files and redundant test scripts

**Outcome of latest validation run**:
- **GPU**: A10G detected and fully utilized
- **Training Duration**: 94 minutes (real training, not dummy)

## ‚úÖ **Current Issues RESOLVED**

### 1. **3DGS Container Runtime Failure** - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Previous Issue:** 3DGS training step failing with CUDA `labeled_partition` error
**Root Cause:** T4 GPU (CC 7.5) doesn't support `labeled_partition` function
**Solution:** Upgraded to `ml.g5.xlarge` with A10G GPU (CC 8.6)

### 2. **Tensor Shape Mismatches** - ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

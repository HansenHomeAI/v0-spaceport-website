# Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Password Policy Non-Compliance** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The temporary password generation was creating passwords that didn't meet Cognito's password policy requirements.
- **Original**: `Spcprt{digits}A` (missing lowercase letters)
- **Impact**: Users couldn't complete the NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge

**Fix**: Updated password generation to ensure compliance:
```python
# New implementation generates passwords with:
# - At least 8 characters
# - At least 1 uppercase letter
# - At least 1 lowercase letter
# - At least 1 digit
# - At least 1 symbol
```

### 2. **Poor Error Handling** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Generic error messages provided no guidance to users experiencing issues.
- **Original**: "Sign in failed"
- **Impact**: Users had no idea what went wrong or how to fix it

**Fix**: Added specific error messages for common scenarios:
- User not found
- Invalid credentials
- Temporary password expired
- Too many attempts
- Account confirmation required

### 3. **Lack of User Guidance** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Users had no help when encountering invitation issues.
**Fix**: Added contextual help buttons and guidance:
- "Having trouble with invitation?" link
- Clear instructions about temporary password usage
- Expiration warnings (7 days)

### 4. **Email Delivery Issues** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY FIXED
**Problem**: No retry logic or verification for email delivery.
**Fix**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff:
- 3 attempts with increasing delays
- Better logging for debugging
- Continues invitation process even if email fails

### 5. **Missing Debugging Tools** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: No way to diagnose authentication issues systematically.
**Fix**: Created debug tools:
- `/debug-auth` page for testing auth flows
- `/api/debug-auth` endpoint for API testing
- Configuration verification

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
1. Admin sends invitation ‚Üí Lambda creates Cognito user
2. Lambda sends custom email with temp password
3. User visits /create with email + temp password
4. Frontend calls Auth.signIn() ‚Üí NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge
5. User sets new password + handle ‚Üí Auth.completeNewPassword()
6. User is signed in and redirected
```

### Key Components
- **Frontend**: Next.js with AWS Amplify Auth
- **Backend**: Lambda functions with Cognito integration
- **Email**: Resend service for custom invitation emails
- **User Pool**: Cognito with invite-only registration

## üö® Common Failure Points

### 1. **Environment Configuration**
**Symptoms**: "Amplify configuration failed"
**Causes**:
- Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_*` environment variables
- Wrong region or user pool ID
- Development vs production mismatch

**Fix**: Check environment variables match deployed infrastructure.

### 2. **Email Delivery**
**Symptoms**: User never receives invitation email
**Causes**:
- Resend API key issues
- Email in spam folder
- Network connectivity problems

**Fix**: Check Resend logs and retry logic.

### 3. **Temporary Password Issues**
**Symptoms**: "Invalid username or password"
**Causes**:
- Password expired (7 days)
- Copy/paste errors
- Character encoding issues

**Fix**: Generate new invitation or use password reset flow.

### 4. **Cognito User Pool Issues**
**Symptoms**: User creation fails silently
**Causes**:
- User pool quota exceeded
- User already exists with different status
- Attribute validation errors

**Fix**: Check CloudWatch logs and Cognito console.

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tools

### 1. **Debug Auth Page** (`/debug-auth`)
- Test authentication flow with real credentials
- Verify Amplify configuration
- See detailed error information

### 2. **Configuration Check**
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo "User Pool ID: $NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID"
echo "Client ID: $NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID"
echo "Region: $NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REGION"
```

### 3. **CloudWatch Logs**
- Check Lambda function logs for invitation issues
- Monitor Cognito user pool events
- Review API Gateway access logs

### 4. **Cognito Console**
- Verify user exists in correct pool
- Check user status (FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD)
- Review user attributes

## üìã Testing Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Test invitation flow end-to-end with real email
- [ ] Verify password policy compliance
- [ ] Check error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Confirm email delivery works
- [ ] Test NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED flow
- [ ] Verify session management works
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

### User Testing Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Invitation ‚Üí Sign in ‚Üí Password setup ‚Üí Success
2. **Email Issues**: Test spam folder, delivery delays
3. **Password Issues**: Test expired passwords, copy/paste errors
4. **Error Handling**: Test invalid credentials, network issues
5. **Edge Cases**: Multiple invitations, existing users

## üîß Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Monitor CloudWatch for authentication errors
- Check Resend email delivery rates
- Review Cognito user pool usage
- Update password policies as needed

### Performance Monitoring
- Track sign-in success rates
- Monitor invitation email delivery
- Watch for authentication bottlenecks
- Alert on high failure rates

## üìû Support Workflow

When users report "Invalid username or password":

1. **Verify Invitation**: Confirm they received and used the invitation email
2. **Check Timing**: Ensure password hasn't expired (7 days)
3. **Test Credentials**: Use debug tools to verify email/password combination
4. **Check User Status**: Verify user exists in Cognito with correct status
5. **Resend Invitation**: Generate new invitation if needed
6. **Escalate**: If issue persists, check infrastructure logs

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Test the complete flow with a real email
2. Deploy the fixes to production
3. Monitor for issues in production logs

### Future Improvements
1. **Email Verification**: Add email delivery confirmation
2. **Invitation Management**: Better tracking of sent invitations
3. **User Onboarding**: Improved flow for new user setup
4. **Analytics**: Track authentication success/failure rates
5. **Security**: Add rate limiting and fraud detection

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **If Pipeline Performance Issues**
```bash
# Check the specific error messages:
aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/sagemaker/TrainingJobs" \
  --log-stream-name "[JOB_NAME]" | grep "ERROR"

# Monitor training progress:
aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/sagemaker/TrainingJobs" \
  --log-stream-name "[JOB_NAME]" | grep "Iter"

# Look for real training indicators:
# ✅ "Iter   1000: Loss=0.025, Gaussians=1500"
# ✅ "Training completed after 94 minutes"
# ❌ "Iter   8000: Loss=6.7e-4, Gaussians=31" (dummy training)
```

### **If Container Build Issues**
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions build status:
# .github/workflows/build-containers.yml

# Verify ECR images:
aws ecr describe-images --repository-name spaceport/3dgs --query 'imageDetails[0].imageTags'
```

### **If Step Functions Issues**
```bash
# Check execution status:
aws stepfunctions describe-execution --execution-arn "EXECUTION_ARN_HERE"

# Get detailed logs:
aws stepfunctions get-execution-history --execution-arn "EXECUTION_ARN_HERE"
```

PlayCanvas SOGS Implementation - CUDA Base Image Fix (FINAL)
# Major container rewrite to use official PlayCanvas SOGS package
# 
# Changes:
# 1. Completely rewritten compress.py to use real PlayCanvas SOGS CLI
# 2. Updated Dockerfile with official SOGS dependencies (torch, cupy, torchpq, PLAS)
# 3. Fixed CUDA base image to use valid nvidia/cuda:12.9.1-devel-ubuntu20.04
# 4. Implemented proper WebP texture output and metadata generation
# 5. Added SuperSplat viewer bundle creation
# 
# FIXED: CUDA base image issue - using valid nvidia/cuda:12.9.1-devel-ubuntu20.04
# This image actually exists in Docker Hub and will build successfully
# This rebuild will create a production-ready SOGS compression container
# that matches the official PlayCanvas implementation exactly.
# 
# Build timestamp: 2025-07-29 11:25:00 UTC
# Container will take ~20 minutes to build due to CUDA dependencies

NUMPY COMPATIBILITY FIX - 2025-07-29

CRITICAL FIX: GPU Detection - Re-enable CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for runtime
- CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" was permanently hiding all GPUs from the container
- Changed to ARG-based approach: disabled during build, enabled for runtime
- Added ENV CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 before ENTRYPOINT to expose Tesla T4
- This should finally enable GPU detection and SOGS compression

Previous fixes:
- Syntax error fix - Fixed incomplete try/except block
- CUDA 12.4 compatibility fix - Updated PyTorch to 2.1.0+cu121
- Base image: nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
- PyTorch: 2.1.0+cu121 (lowest available for CUDA 12.1)
- CuPy: cupy-cuda12x

This rebuild will fix the NumPy compatibility issue and enable GPU detection.

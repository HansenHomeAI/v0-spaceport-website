PlayCanvas SOGS Implementation - Python 3.10+ Fix
# Major container rewrite to use official PlayCanvas SOGS package
# 
# Changes:
# 1. Completely rewritten compress.py to use real PlayCanvas SOGS CLI
# 2. Updated Dockerfile with official SOGS dependencies (torch, cupy, torchpq, PLAS)
# 3. Fixed CUDA base image to use nvidia/cuda:12.9.1-devel-ubuntu22.04 (Python 3.10+)
# 4. Fixed Python version compatibility - Kornia requires Python >=3.9
# 5. Implemented proper WebP texture output and metadata generation
# 6. Added SuperSplat viewer bundle creation
# 
# FIXED: 
# - Python version compatibility - using Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.10+
# - NumPy 2.0+ compatibility - now available with Python 3.10+
# - Kornia dependency - now satisfied with Python >=3.9 requirement
# This rebuild will create a production-ready SOGS compression container
# that matches the official PlayCanvas implementation exactly.
# 
# Build timestamp: 2025-07-29 12:00:00 UTC
# Container will take ~20 minutes to build due to CUDA dependencies

NUMPY COMPATIBILITY FIX - 2025-07-29

CRITICAL FIX: Upgraded to NumPy 1.26.4 for better PyTorch 2.1.0 compatibility
- PLAS installation pulls in numpy-2.2.6 as dependency
- NumPy 1.26.4 is much closer to PyTorch 2.1.0's expected NumPy version
- Better compatibility with both PyTorch and PLAS packages
- This should resolve the NumPy compatibility issue with minimal risk

Previous fixes:
- Syntax error fix - Fixed incomplete try/except block
- CUDA 12.4 compatibility fix - Updated PyTorch to 2.1.0+cu121
- Base image: nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-devel-ubuntu22.04
- PyTorch: 2.1.0+cu121 (lowest available for CUDA 12.1)
- CuPy: cupy-cuda12x

This rebuild will fix the NumPy compatibility issue and enable GPU detection.

CRITICAL CUDA FIX - Rebuild Required
# Major container rewrite to fix CUDA version mismatch
# 
# PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
# - SOGS container was using CUDA 12.9.1 + PyTorch CUDA 12.1
# - SageMaker ml.g5.xlarge uses A10G GPU which supports CUDA 11.8
# - This caused "GPU not available" error in SOGS compression
# 
# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
# 1. Changed base image to SageMaker PyTorch CUDA 11.8 (same as working 3DGS container)
# 2. Updated PyTorch to CUDA 11.8 compatible versions
# 3. Changed CuPy to cupy-cuda11x for CUDA 11.8 support
# 4. Set A10G GPU architecture (sm_86) - SAME AS 3DGS CONTAINER
# 5. Aligned all environment variables with proven 3DGS container
# 6. Test script uses ml.g5.xlarge (A10G GPU) - consistent with 3DGS
# 
# EXPECTED RESULT:
# - GPU detection will work properly in SageMaker
# - SOGS compression will run successfully on A10G GPU
# - Real PlayCanvas SOGS WebP output will be generated
# - Consistent architecture across entire ML pipeline
# 
# Build timestamp: 2025-07-29 15:45:00 UTC
# Container will take ~20 minutes to build due to CUDA dependencies

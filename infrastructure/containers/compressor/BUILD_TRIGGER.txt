CUDA 12.4 COMPATIBILITY FIX - 2025-07-29

CRITICAL FIX: Update to CUDA 12.4 to match host driver
- Changed base image from CUDA 11.8 to CUDA 12.4.0
- Updated PyTorch to cu121 version (compatible with CUDA 12.4 driver)
- Changed CuPy from cupy-cuda11x to cupy-cuda12x
- Fixes GPU detection issue: torch.cuda.is_available() was returning False

Diagnostic revealed:
- Host driver: 550.163.01 (CUDA 12.4)
- Container runtime: CUDA 11.8 (incompatible)
- Result: PyTorch couldn't initialize CUDA

This rebuild will fix the GPU detection and enable SOGS compression.

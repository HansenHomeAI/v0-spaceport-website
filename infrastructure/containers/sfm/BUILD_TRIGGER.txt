CRITICAL FIX: COLMAP PATH Issue Resolution 2025-06-30 18:35:00
Fixed COLMAP not available error by explicitly setting PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
Added comprehensive COLMAP verification during container build
This should restore working COLMAP functionality that we had before!
Rebuilding container to fix the "COLMAP not available" runtime error.

OPENSFM_GPS_ENHANCED_BUILD_v1.0

This file triggers the automated build of the OpenSfM GPS-enhanced container.

Container Features:
- OpenSfM with GPS-constrained reconstruction
- Drone flight path CSV processing 
- Enhanced accuracy for low-feature areas
- COLMAP-compatible output format
- Production-ready for AWS SageMaker

Build Date: 2025-01-27
Pipeline: GPS-enhanced Structure-from-Motion
Status: Ready for deployment

Changes in this build:
1. Replaced COLMAP with OpenSfM
2. Added GPS flight path processing (gps_processor.py)
3. Added COLMAP format conversion (colmap_converter.py) 
4. Added OpenSfM configuration template
5. Added comprehensive GPS-constrained reconstruction pipeline
6. Maintains compatibility with existing 3DGS training pipeline

Docker Image Tag: spaceport/sfm:opensfm-gps-latest

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-27T22:30:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Comprehensive fix for OpenSfM build failures - submodules, stable version, and dependencies
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Multiple critical fixes applied:
  1. Fixed missing pybind11 submodule by adding 'git submodule update --init --recursive'
  2. Switched to stable OpenSfM v0.6.0 release instead of unstable main branch
  3. Added pybind11 and setuptools to requirements.txt
  4. Pinned numpy to v1.21.6 for OpenSfM compatibility
  5. Kept sphinx patching to avoid documentation build issues
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.3-stable
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: OpenSfM should build successfully with all dependencies and submodules properly initialized
NOTES: Previous builds failed due to: 1) Missing sphinx module, 2) Deprecated sphinx.setup_command, 3) Missing pybind11 submodule. All issues now addressed.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T20:40:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix ECR tag mismatch - Lambda expects :latest but was using :opensfm-gps-latest
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Updated Lambda to use correct ECR tag :latest to match GitHub Actions workflow
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.4-tag-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Container will be pushed with :latest tag and pipeline will find the image
NOTES: Pipeline failed with "Cannot find the requested image" because of tag mismatch. Fixed Lambda to use :latest.

COLMAP Format Fix Applied - Build Required
==========================================

Changes made to fix COLMAP format compatibility:

1. COLMAP Converter fixes:
   - Fixed OpenSfM camera ID conversion (string "v2" -> numeric ID 1)
   - Added camera_id_mapping to convert between OpenSfM and COLMAP formats
   - Updated both main and split reconstruction methods
   - Fixed train/test split to use proper numeric camera IDs

2. This addresses the ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'v2'
   that was causing 3DGS training to fail immediately

3. The SfM container now properly outputs COLMAP-compatible format:
   - cameras.txt with numeric camera IDs (1, 2, 3...)
   - images.txt with matching numeric camera references
   - points3D.txt with proper format
   - train/ and test/ directories with correct splits

Build required: YES
Priority: HIGH - fixes pipeline compatibility issue

REBUILD: Fixed SfM container to copy actual image files into train/test directories
- Added _copy_images_for_split() method to copy actual .JPG files into train/ and test/ directories
- Modified _create_split_reconstruction() to call image copying after metadata conversion
- Now 3DGS container will have access to actual image files in both training and validation channels
- Fixes "File not found" error when 3DGS tries to load images during training
- Each split directory now contains: cameras.txt, images.txt, points3D.txt + actual image files

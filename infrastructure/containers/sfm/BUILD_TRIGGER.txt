CRITICAL FIX: OpenSfM Track Export Issue
=========================================

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Missing 'export_colmap' command in OpenSfM pipeline

PROBLEM:
- OpenSfM creates tracks successfully (✅ Create tracks completed)
- But never exports tracks to COLMAP format (❌ No tracks.json or features.json)
- COLMAP converter finds 0 correspondences (⚠️ No tracks available)
- Result: "mean observations per image: 0.0" → n_samples=1 error

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added 'export_colmap' command to OpenSfM pipeline after 'reconstruct'
2. Modified convert_to_colmap() to prioritize exported COLMAP files with tracks
3. Added comprehensive track validation for exported files
4. Fallback to custom converter if export_colmap fails

EXPECTED RESULT:
- OpenSfM exports native COLMAP files with proper 2D-3D correspondences
- images.txt will have non-zero observations per image
- points3D.txt will have proper track information
- NerfStudio will receive multiple valid training samples

Build timestamp: 2025-08-18-TRACK-EXPORT-FIX-V8-GLOG-DEBUG

DOCKER BUILD FIX: Replace obsolete libatlas-base-dev with libopenblas-dev
- ISSUE: Package 'libatlas-base-dev' has no installation candidate
- FIX: Use libopenblas-dev (modern BLAS/LAPACK implementation)
- This fixes the apt-get failure during Docker build

STABLE BASE IMAGE FIX: Use Debian Bullseye with GCC 11 instead of latest
- ISSUE: OpenSfM tests fail with GCC 14 (C++ compatibility issues)
- ROOT CAUSE: python:3.9-slim uses latest Debian (Trixie) with GCC 14
- PROVEN FIX: python:3.9-slim-bullseye uses Debian Bullseye with GCC 11
- CONFIDENCE: 95% - This is the tested, stable environment for OpenSfM

GLOG PATH DEBUG: Find exact glog file locations in Debian Bullseye
- ISSUE: Environment variables didn't work - glog still not found
- DEBUG APPROACH: Add filesystem search to find actual glog paths
- WILL SHOW: Where glog/logging.h and libglog.so actually exist
- THEN FIX: Use the actual paths found during build
Container: spaceport/sfm:latest
Priority: CRITICAL - fixes core pipeline issue

FINAL FIX: Skip setup.py install entirely - Manual Python package copy
=====================================================================

ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Dual CMake problem in OpenSfM
- ✅ Manual cmake works (422s build time confirms compilation succeeded)
- ❌ setup.py install runs its own broken CMake without our glog parameters

EVIDENCE FROM BUILD #3:
- Manual CMake took 422 seconds (vs 4s failures) = SUCCESS
- Then setup.py install failed with same old glog error = FAILURE

FINAL SOLUTION: Skip setup.py install completely
1. Manual cmake with explicit glog paths (WORKS)
2. make (WORKS) 
3. Direct copy to site-packages: `cp -r opensfm /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/`
4. Skip the problematic setup.py install step entirely

ADVANTAGES:
- Uses successfully compiled OpenSfM C++ extensions
- Bypasses broken setup.py install completely  
- Direct Python package installation

EXPECTED RESULT:
- CMake compilation succeeds (proven in build #3)
- No secondary CMake failure from setup.py
- OpenSfM available for tracks export to 3DGS

LESSON: Sometimes you need to bypass broken Python packaging entirely.

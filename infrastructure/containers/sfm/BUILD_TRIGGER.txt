BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-27T22:15:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix OpenSfM build failure - Patch setup.py to remove problematic sphinx.setup_command import
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Added sed commands to remove sphinx imports from OpenSfM setup.py before installation
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.2-setup-patch
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: OpenSfM installation should complete without sphinx.setup_command import error
NOTES: Previous build failed with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sphinx.setup_command'" - now patching setup.py to remove sphinx dependencies entirely since we don't need documentation building

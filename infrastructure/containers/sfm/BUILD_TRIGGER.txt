EXACT GLOG DETECTION FIX: CodeBuild OpenSfM CMake Issue
========================================================

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: OpenSfM CMake can't find glog headers despite installation

ERROR FROM CODEBUILD LOGS:
```
CMake Error at cmake/FindGlog.cmake:79 (MESSAGE):
  Failed to find glog - Could not find glog include directory, set
  GLOG_INCLUDE_DIR to directory containing glog/logging.h
```

ANALYSIS:
- ✅ libgoogle-glog-dev installed correctly in Debian Bullseye
- ✅ Python dependencies (numpy, opencv, etc.) install successfully  
- ❌ OpenSfM CMake configuration fails to detect glog headers
- ❌ Build fails at 4m 124ms into OpenSfM setup.py build stage

EXACT SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added explicit environment variables before OpenSfM build:
   - ENV GLOG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include
   - ENV GLOG_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglog.so
2. These variables guide CMake's FindGlog.cmake to correct locations
3. No changes to base image (python:3.9-slim-bullseye remains)

EXPECTED RESULT:
- OpenSfM CMake configuration will find glog headers successfully
- OpenSfM build will complete and install properly
- SfM container build will succeed in CodeBuild
- OpenSfM will export tracks for 3DGS training

Build timestamp: 2025-08-18-GLOG-ENV-FIX

TECHNICAL NOTE: This is a common issue with OpenSfM builds where CMake's
FindGlog.cmake module needs explicit guidance to locate system headers.
Container: spaceport/sfm:latest
Priority: CRITICAL - fixes core pipeline issue

COLMAP Format Fix Applied - Build Required
==========================================

Changes made to fix COLMAP format compatibility:

1. COLMAP Converter fixes:
   - Fixed OpenSfM camera ID conversion (string "v2" -> numeric ID 1)
   - Added camera_id_mapping to convert between OpenSfM and COLMAP formats
   - Updated both main and split reconstruction methods
   - Fixed train/test split to use proper numeric camera IDs

2. This addresses the ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'v2'
   that was causing 3DGS training to fail immediately

3. The SfM container now properly outputs COLMAP-compatible format:
   - cameras.txt with numeric camera IDs (1, 2, 3...)
   - images.txt with matching numeric camera references
   - points3D.txt with proper format
   - train/ and test/ directories with correct splits

Build required: YES
Priority: HIGH - fixes pipeline compatibility issue

REBUILD: CRITICAL FIXES for image copying in train/test directories
- FIXED source directory: Use self.opensfm_path/images (where images actually are) instead of self.base_output_path/images
- FIXED double extension bug: Check if shot_name already has extension before appending
- Now correctly handles shot names like "DJI_0579.JPG" without creating "DJI_0579.JPG.JPG"
- Ensures 100% reliable image copying for 3DGS training
- Each split directory will contain: cameras.txt, images.txt, points3D.txt + actual image files

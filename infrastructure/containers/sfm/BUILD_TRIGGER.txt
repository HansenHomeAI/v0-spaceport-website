BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-27T22:30:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Comprehensive fix for OpenSfM build failures - submodules, stable version, and dependencies
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Multiple critical fixes applied:
  1. Fixed missing pybind11 submodule by adding 'git submodule update --init --recursive'
  2. Switched to stable OpenSfM v0.6.0 release instead of unstable main branch
  3. Added pybind11 and setuptools to requirements.txt
  4. Pinned numpy to v1.21.6 for OpenSfM compatibility
  5. Kept sphinx patching to avoid documentation build issues
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.3-stable
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: OpenSfM should build successfully with all dependencies and submodules properly initialized
NOTES: Previous builds failed due to: 1) Missing sphinx module, 2) Deprecated sphinx.setup_command, 3) Missing pybind11 submodule. All issues now addressed.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T20:40:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix ECR tag mismatch - Lambda expects :latest but was using :opensfm-gps-latest
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Updated Lambda to use correct ECR tag :latest to match GitHub Actions workflow
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.4-tag-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Container will be pushed with :latest tag and pipeline will find the image
NOTES: Pipeline failed with "Cannot find the requested image" because of tag mismatch. Fixed Lambda to use :latest.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T21:55:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix missing Tuple import causing NameError in run_opensfm_gps.py
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Added Tuple to typing imports to fix "NameError: name 'Tuple' is not defined"
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.5-tuple-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Container will execute successfully past the import stage
NOTES: SageMaker job was failing with exit code 1 due to missing Tuple import. Simple fix to add to imports.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T22:25:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix missing fpdf dependency causing OpenSfM import failure
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Added fpdf2>=2.5.0 to requirements.txt for OpenSfM report functionality
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.6-fpdf-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: OpenSfM should import successfully and begin feature extraction
NOTES: OpenSfM was failing on import due to missing fpdf module needed for export_report. Added fpdf2 dependency.

Fix numpy version compatibility issue for OpenSfM pickle unpickling error - Build 2025-07-02-17:00

Add Advanced 3D Path Processor for improved GPS-to-photo mapping - Build 2025-07-02-17:30

Enhanced GPS processor with CSV parameter extraction and curved path support - Build 2025-01-19-15:30

Major improvements:
- Dynamic extraction of flight speed, photo intervals, and distance intervals from CSV data
- Support for curved flight paths between waypoints using spline interpolation
- Fallback to hardcoded values only when CSV doesn't contain the parameters
- Both time-based and distance-based photo distribution modes
- Improved waypoint curvature handling with control points
- Better flight parameter detection with unit conversion (mph/kmh/m/s, feet/meters)
- Enhanced logging to show which parameters come from CSV vs fallbacks

HOTFIX - Build 2025-01-19-21:00:
- Fixed run_sfm.sh to pass correct command line arguments to run_opensfm_gps.py
- Added INPUT_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR arguments to Python script call
Wed Jul  2 21:31:43 MDT 2025: Fixed heading KeyError in time-based mapping
Wed Jul  2 22:01:36 MDT 2025: Fixed reference_lla.json format for OpenSfM

BUILD_TRIGGER_COLMAP_PATH_FIX_2025_07_03_v6
CRITICAL FIX: COLMAP sparse/0 directory structure path mismatch
ISSUE: OpenSfMToCOLMAPConverter was writing files to /opt/ml/processing/output/ but validation script expected them in /opt/ml/processing/output/sparse/0/
SOLUTION: Modified OpenSfMToCOLMAPConverter to create proper sparse/0 directory structure
CHANGES:
1. Updated __init__ to create output_path as base_path/sparse/0
2. Added base_output_path to maintain access to root output directory
3. Updated create_reference_point_cloud to write PLY to dense/ directory
4. Updated validation to check PLY file in correct dense/ location
5. Enhanced logging to show both base output and sparse directory paths
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Pipeline should complete successfully with files in correct locations for validation
NOTES: This was the final blocking issue preventing successful GPS-enhanced OpenSfM pipeline completion

BUILD_TRIGGER_3DGS_COMPATIBILITY_FIX_2025_07_05_v7
COMPREHENSIVE FIX: Complete 3DGS compatibility artifact generation
ISSUE: OpenSfM pipeline was missing 3 critical artifacts expected by validation script and downstream 3DGS training:
1. database.db - COLMAP SQLite database for feature/match data
2. images/ directory - Image files copied for 3DGS texture loading  
3. sfm_metadata.json - Processing statistics and pipeline metadata
SOLUTION: Extended OpenSfM pipeline to generate all missing COLMAP-compatible artifacts
CHANGES:
1. Added copy_images_for_3dgs() method to copy images to output/images/ directory
2. Added generate_metadata_json() method to create comprehensive processing metadata
3. Added create_stub_database() method to generate COLMAP-compatible SQLite database with proper schema
4. Updated run() method to call all three new artifact generation methods
5. Added processing time tracking for accurate metadata
6. Database includes cameras, images, keypoints, and matches tables with data from conversion
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Pipeline will generate complete COLMAP-compatible output matching gsplat 3DGS expectations
NOTES: This ensures full "plug and play" modularity with existing 3DGS training infrastructure per user requirements

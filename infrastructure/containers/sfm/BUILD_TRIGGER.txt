CRITICAL FIX: Train/Test Split Output Structure - 2025-01-09

MAJOR ENHANCEMENT: SfM now outputs proper train/test split structure for 3DGS training

NEW FEATURES:
1. TRAIN/TEST SPLIT COLMAP OUTPUT:
   - Creates separate train/ and test/ directories with COLMAP reconstructions
   - 80/20 split by default (configurable)
   - Each directory contains cameras.txt, images.txt, points3D.txt
   - Maintains backward compatibility with sparse/0/ structure

2. ENHANCED VALIDATION:
   - Validates both train and test directories exist
   - Counts images in each split
   - Quality check includes train/test split requirements
   - Comprehensive logging of split statistics

3. IMPROVED COLMAP CONVERTER:
   - create_train_test_split() method for consistent splitting
   - create_split_reconstructions() for separate COLMAP outputs
   - Enhanced validation with train/test directory checks
   - Proper file copying to final output locations

This addresses the critical issue where 3DGS training expected train/test
subdirectories but SfM was outputting a flat structure. Now the pipeline
is properly modular with plug-and-play compatibility.

Expected Output Structure:
/opt/ml/processing/output/
├── sparse/0/           # Original structure (backward compatibility)
│   ├── cameras.txt
│   ├── images.txt
│   └── points3D.txt
├── train/              # NEW: Training split
│   ├── cameras.txt
│   ├── images.txt
│   └── points3D.txt
├── test/               # NEW: Test split
│   ├── cameras.txt
│   ├── images.txt
│   └── points3D.txt
├── dense/
│   └── sparse_points.ply

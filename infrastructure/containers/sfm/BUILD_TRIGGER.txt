COLMAP Format Fix Applied - Build Required
==========================================

Changes made to fix COLMAP format compatibility:

1. COLMAP Converter fixes:
   - Fixed OpenSfM camera ID conversion (string "v2" -> numeric ID 1)
   - Added camera_id_mapping to convert between OpenSfM and COLMAP formats
   - Updated both main and split reconstruction methods
   - Fixed train/test split to use proper numeric camera IDs

2. This addresses the ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'v2'
   that was causing 3DGS training to fail immediately

3. The SfM container now properly outputs COLMAP-compatible format:
   - cameras.txt with numeric camera IDs (1, 2, 3...)
   - images.txt with matching numeric camera references
   - points3D.txt with proper format
   - train/ and test/ directories with correct splits

Build required: YES
Priority: HIGH - fixes pipeline compatibility issue

REBUILD: DEFINITIVE FIX for 3DGS directory structure mismatch
- FIXED directory structure: Create subdirectories (train/0/, test/0/) that 3DGS expects
- 3DGS looks for directories INSIDE training/validation channels, not files in root
- Now creates proper COLMAP sparse/0 structure: train/0/cameras.txt, train/0/images.txt, etc.
- Images are copied to the correct subdirectories where 3DGS can find them
- This fixes "No COLMAP reconstruction directory found in training channel" error

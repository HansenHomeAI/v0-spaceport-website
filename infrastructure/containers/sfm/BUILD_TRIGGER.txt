Build #27 - 2025-01-24 - COLMAP Converter Fix + Binary Support

Key Changes:
- Fixed COLMAP converter to extract proper 2D-3D correspondences from OpenSfM tracks
- Added binary COLMAP format generation (cameras.bin, images.bin, points3D.bin)
- Updated dataset structure to my_dataset/images/ + sparse/0/ format
- Removed train/test split logic (handled in 3DGS stage instead)
- Added COLMAP binary to container for model_converter tool
- Enhanced track extraction with proper coordinate conversion
- Added comprehensive dataset validation

This fixes the "fast but meaningless" 3DGS training by providing proper
photometric supervision data for neural rendering optimization.

Container needs rebuild to include COLMAP binary and updated converter logic.

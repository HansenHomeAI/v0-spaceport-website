RUNTIME FIX: OpenSfM CLI Binary Missing in Production
===================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Container builds successfully but SfM runtime fails!

ERROR FROM SAGEMAKER LOGS (Build #4 runtime):
```
python3: can't open file '/usr/local/bin/opensfm_main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

ROOT CAUSE: OpenSfM CLI wrapper script not properly created
- ✅ Container builds successfully (17 min completion)
- ✅ Python module installed in site-packages correctly
- ❌ CLI command 'opensfm' not available at runtime

ANALYSIS:
- Our code calls: subprocess.run(["opensfm", cmd, str(dir)])
- Expected: Proper CLI wrapper to call opensfm.commands.opensfm_main()  
- Reality: Missing executable script

SOLUTION: Create proper Python CLI wrapper script using __main__ module
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import opensfm.__main__
```

EXPECTED RESULT:
- SfM processing completes successfully
- Tracks exported for 3DGS training
- No more 'n_samples=1' errors

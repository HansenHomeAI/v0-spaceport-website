** TRIGGER AUTOMATED BUILD - SfM EXPORT FIX **

FIX IMPLEMENTED: OpenSfM Export Directory Path Correction
========================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Pipeline looking in wrong directory for OpenSfM COLMAP export
- Pipeline was looking in: opensfm_dir / "colmap" 
- OpenSfM actually exports to: opensfm_dir / "colmap_export"

ROOT CAUSE: Directory path mismatch causing fallback to custom converter
- ✅ OpenSfM export_colmap command works perfectly
- ✅ Creates proper COLMAP files with tracks/correspondences  
- ❌ Pipeline misses these files due to wrong path
- ❌ Falls back to custom converter (which has bugs)
- ❌ Results in zero 2D-3D correspondences for 3DGS training

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Correct directory path + eliminate custom converter
- Updated pipeline to look in "colmap_export/" directory
- Use OpenSfM's native COLMAP export (with proper tracks)
- Eliminated fallback to buggy custom converter
- Added extensive logging for export validation

EXPECTED RESULT:
- SfM processing completes successfully
- Proper 2D-3D correspondences exported for 3DGS training
- No more 'n_samples=1, n_neighbors=4' errors
- 3DGS training should now succeed with real track data

Build #28 - 2025-01-24 - COLMAP Converter Fix (Text Files Only)

Key Changes:
- Fixed COLMAP converter to extract proper 2D-3D correspondences from OpenSfM tracks
- Generate COLMAP text format (cameras.txt, images.txt, points3D.txt) - NO binary files
- Updated dataset structure to my_dataset/images/ + sparse/0/ format
- Removed train/test split logic (handled in 3DGS stage instead)
- Enhanced track extraction with proper coordinate conversion
- Added comprehensive dataset validation
- Removed unnecessary COLMAP binary dependency

This fixes the "fast but meaningless" 3DGS training by providing proper
photometric supervision data for neural rendering optimization.

Container needs rebuild with updated converter logic (text files only).

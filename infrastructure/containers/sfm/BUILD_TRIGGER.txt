CRITICAL FIX: OpenSfM Track Export Issue
=========================================

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Missing 'export_colmap' command in OpenSfM pipeline

PROBLEM:
- OpenSfM creates tracks successfully (✅ Create tracks completed)
- But never exports tracks to COLMAP format (❌ No tracks.json or features.json)
- COLMAP converter finds 0 correspondences (⚠️ No tracks available)
- Result: "mean observations per image: 0.0" → n_samples=1 error

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added 'export_colmap' command to OpenSfM pipeline after 'reconstruct'
2. Modified convert_to_colmap() to prioritize exported COLMAP files with tracks
3. Added comprehensive track validation for exported files
4. Fallback to custom converter if export_colmap fails

EXPECTED RESULT:
- OpenSfM exports native COLMAP files with proper 2D-3D correspondences
- images.txt will have non-zero observations per image
- points3D.txt will have proper track information
- NerfStudio will receive multiple valid training samples

Build timestamp: 2025-08-18-MINIMAL-BULLSEYE-FIX

MINIMAL CHANGE: Pin to stable base image that worked in July 2025
- ONLY CHANGE: python:3.9-slim → python:3.9-slim-bullseye  
- REASON: Rolling tag updated from GCC 11 → GCC 14 between July-August
- EVIDENCE: SfM built successfully in July with same Dockerfile
- NO OTHER CHANGES: Keep simple OpenSfM build, no glog hacks

LESSON: Pin production Docker tags to avoid environment drift
Container: spaceport/sfm:latest
Priority: CRITICAL - fixes core pipeline issue

** TRIGGER AUTOMATED BUILD **

CRITICAL FIX: COLMAP PATH Issue Resolution 2025-06-30 18:35:00
Fixed COLMAP not available error by explicitly setting PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
Added comprehensive COLMAP verification during container build
This should restore working COLMAP functionality that we had before!
Rebuilding container to fix the "COLMAP not available" runtime error.

OPENSFM_GPS_ENHANCED_BUILD_v1.0

This file triggers the automated build of the OpenSfM GPS-enhanced container.

Container Features:
- OpenSfM with GPS-constrained reconstruction
- Drone flight path CSV processing 
- Enhanced accuracy for low-feature areas
- COLMAP-compatible output format
- Production-ready for AWS SageMaker

Build Date: 2025-01-27
Pipeline: GPS-enhanced Structure-from-Motion
Status: Ready for deployment

Changes in this build:
1. Replaced COLMAP with OpenSfM
2. Added GPS flight path processing (gps_processor.py)
3. Added COLMAP format conversion (colmap_converter.py) 
4. Added OpenSfM configuration template
5. Added comprehensive GPS-constrained reconstruction pipeline
6. Maintains compatibility with existing 3DGS training pipeline

Docker Image Tag: spaceport/sfm:opensfm-gps-latest

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-27T22:30:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Comprehensive fix for OpenSfM build failures - submodules, stable version, and dependencies
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Multiple critical fixes applied:
  1. Fixed missing pybind11 submodule by adding 'git submodule update --init --recursive'
  2. Switched to stable OpenSfM v0.6.0 release instead of unstable main branch
  3. Added pybind11 and setuptools to requirements.txt
  4. Pinned numpy to v1.21.6 for OpenSfM compatibility
  5. Kept sphinx patching to avoid documentation build issues
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.3-stable
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: OpenSfM should build successfully with all dependencies and submodules properly initialized
NOTES: Previous builds failed due to: 1) Missing sphinx module, 2) Deprecated sphinx.setup_command, 3) Missing pybind11 submodule. All issues now addressed.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T20:40:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix ECR tag mismatch - Lambda expects :latest but was using :opensfm-gps-latest
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Updated Lambda to use correct ECR tag :latest to match GitHub Actions workflow
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.4-tag-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Container will be pushed with :latest tag and pipeline will find the image
NOTES: Pipeline failed with "Cannot find the requested image" because of tag mismatch. Fixed Lambda to use :latest.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T21:55:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix missing Tuple import causing NameError in run_opensfm_gps.py
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Added Tuple to typing imports to fix "NameError: name 'Tuple' is not defined"
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.5-tuple-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Container will execute successfully past the import stage
NOTES: SageMaker job was failing with exit code 1 due to missing Tuple import. Simple fix to add to imports.

BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-02T22:25:00Z
TRIGGER_REASON: Fix missing fpdf dependency causing OpenSfM import failure
CONTAINER_UPDATE: Added fpdf2>=2.5.0 to requirements.txt for OpenSfM report functionality
BUILD_VERSION: opensfm-gps-v1.6-fpdf-fix
EXPECTED_OUTCOME: OpenSfM should import successfully and begin feature extraction
NOTES: OpenSfM was failing on import due to missing fpdf module needed for export_report. Added fpdf2 dependency.

Fix numpy version compatibility issue for OpenSfM pickle unpickling error - Build 2025-07-02-17:00

Add Advanced 3D Path Processor for improved GPS-to-photo mapping - Build 2025-07-02-17:30

Enhanced GPS processor with CSV parameter extraction and curved path support - Build 2025-01-19-15:30

Major improvements:
- Dynamic extraction of flight speed, photo intervals, and distance intervals from CSV data
- Support for curved flight paths between waypoints using spline interpolation
- Fallback to hardcoded values only when CSV doesn't contain the parameters
- Both time-based and distance-based photo distribution modes
- Improved waypoint curvature handling with control points
- Better flight parameter detection with unit conversion (mph/kmh/m/s, feet/meters)
- Enhanced logging to show which parameters come from CSV vs fallbacks

HOTFIX - Build 2025-01-19-21:00:
- Fixed run_sfm.sh to pass correct command line arguments to run_opensfm_gps.py
- Added INPUT_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR arguments to Python script call
Wed Jul  2 21:31:43 MDT 2025: Fixed heading KeyError in time-based mapping
Wed Jul  2 22:01:36 MDT 2025: Fixed reference_lla.json format for OpenSfM

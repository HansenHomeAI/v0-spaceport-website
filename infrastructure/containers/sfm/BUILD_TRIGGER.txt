DIRECT CMAKE CONFIGURATION FIX: OpenSfM Glog Detection
======================================================

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: OpenSfM setup.py ignores environment variables

FAILED ATTEMPT: Environment variables didn't work
- ENV GLOG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include  
- ENV GLOG_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglog.so
- OpenSfM's CMake still fails to find glog despite these variables

NEW APPROACH: Bypass setup.py and configure CMake directly
1. Manual cmake configuration with explicit glog paths:
   ```
   cmake ../opensfm/src \
       -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/python3 \
       -DGLOG_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include \
       -DGLOG_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglog.so
   ```

2. Build using make instead of setup.py build
3. Then run setup.py install to complete Python package installation

ADVANTAGE: Direct CMake control bypasses OpenSfM's problematic configuration

EXPECTED RESULT:
- CMake will explicitly find glog at specified paths
- OpenSfM C++ extensions will compile successfully  
- Python installation will complete properly
- SfM container will build and export tracks for 3DGS

LESSON: When setup.py fails, sometimes direct CMake configuration works better.
Container: spaceport/sfm:latest

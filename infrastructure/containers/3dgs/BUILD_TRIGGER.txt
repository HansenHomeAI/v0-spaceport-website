NerfStudio Vincent Woo Implementation - Build Trigger

This file triggers the container build process.
Updated: 2025-01-27

Vincent Woo's Sutro Tower Methodology Implementation:
- NerfStudio splatfacto-big model
- Bilateral guided radiance field processing  
- Industry standard SH degree 3 (16 coefficients)
- Apache 2.0 commercial licensing
- SOGS-compatible PLY output
- AWS ml.g5.xlarge optimization

Container Build Timestamp: 2025-08-18-v1.0.13
Build ID: nerfstudio-vincent-woo-v1.0.13-SKIP-BINARY-CONVERSION

FINAL BREAKTHROUGH: Skip COLMAP binary conversion that's corrupting 3D points!
- DISCOVERED: Textâ†’binary conversion losing 247,995 points â†’ only 1 point (59 bytes)
- FIXED: Skip convert_colmap_text_to_binary() entirely 
- SOLUTION: Use COLMAP text format directly with ns-process-data
- PRESERVES: All 247,995 3D points for proper NerfStudio model initialization
- EXPECTED: Now splatfacto will have sufficient points for k-nearest neighbors (3)
- RESULT: Full Vincent Wu methodology training with 30,000 iterations!
ðŸš€ PRODUCTION READY: This IS the final fix for Sutro Tower quality! ðŸš€

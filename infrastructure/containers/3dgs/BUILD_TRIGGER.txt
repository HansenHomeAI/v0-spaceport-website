BUILD_TRIGGER_20250107_14:20:00_ENHANCED_TRAINING_QUALITY
- CRITICAL: Comprehensive training quality improvements for complex scenes
- Enhanced densification: increased percent_dense from 0.01 to 0.05 for better detail capture
- Real gradient-based densification with splitting and cloning mechanisms
- PSNR monitoring and auto-extension: extends training if PSNR below target (35dB)
- Comprehensive quality metrics: loss curves, PSNR tracking, model size assessment
- Opacity reset mechanism to prevent degenerate Gaussians
- Enhanced metadata with densification events and quality flags
- Designed for complex scenes like town squares requiring high detail fidelity
- Root user confirmed working - all permission issues resolved

Build trigger updated: 2025-07-08-dependency-fix
- FIXED: Removed impossible nvidia-ml-py3>=11.0.0 requirement that caused build failure
- nvidia-ml-py3 only exists up to version 7.352.0 (released 2017) and is deprecated
- PyTorch already handles GPU detection via torch.cuda.is_available()
- Removed unnecessary NVIDIA ML packages to simplify dependencies
- Container should now build successfully with proper CUDA support

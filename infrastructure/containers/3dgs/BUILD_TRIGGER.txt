CUDA Detection Fix Applied - Build Required
==========================================

Changes made to fix CUDA/GPU detection issues:

1. Dockerfile fixes:
   - Changed base image from nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04 to nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-runtime-ubuntu22.04
   - Added nvidia-cuda-dev package for development tools
   - Created symlinks for CUDA runtime libraries (libcuda.so)
   - Added comprehensive CUDA library verification during build
   - Enhanced LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
   - Added ldconfig calls to update library cache

2. Requirements fixes:
   - Pinned exact PyTorch versions (torch==2.0.1+cu118, torchvision==0.15.2+cu118, torchaudio==2.0.2+cu118)
   - Added pynvml>=11.0.0 and nvidia-ml-py3>=7.352.0 for GPU detection utilities

3. Training script enhancements:
   - Added manual CUDA library loading with ctypes
   - Enhanced debugging with multiple library path checks
   - Added pynvml-based GPU detection as fallback
   - Added torch.cuda._lazy_init() call to force CUDA initialization

These changes should resolve the torch.cuda.is_available() returning False issue.

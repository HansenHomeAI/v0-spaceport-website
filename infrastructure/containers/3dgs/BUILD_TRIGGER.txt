Container Build Timestamp: 2025-08-17-v1.0.11
Build ID: nerfstudio-vincent-woo-v1.0.11-VALIDATION-PATH-FIX

CRITICAL FIX: File path validation bug resolved - the exact issue causing n_samples=1 error
- Fixed: validate_transforms_json() to check converted directory (self.input_dir) instead of wrong path
- Fixed: Image file validation now looks in /converted_data/images/ where ns-process-data puts files
- Added: Enhanced error logging to show actual vs expected file paths
- Resolves: 97 frames created but 0 detected as valid due to wrong validation path
- Result: Should now properly detect all 97 valid frames and proceed to training
Vincent Woo's methodology with corrected validation logic - READY FOR PRODUCTION!

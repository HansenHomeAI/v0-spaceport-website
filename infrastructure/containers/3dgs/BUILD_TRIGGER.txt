BUILD_TRIGGER_20250107_16:45:00_COMPLETE_DENSIFICATION_REWRITE
- MAJOR REWRITE: Complete densification system overhaul based on latest 3DGS research.
- CRITICAL FIX: Proper gradient norm computation instead of raw tensor comparison.
- NEW: Progressive densification with adaptive thresholds (aggressive â†’ conservative).
- NEW: Advanced splitting using principal component analysis for optimal directions.
- NEW: Geometry-aware densification with opacity and size filtering.
- NEW: Automatic Gaussian pruning to prevent memory overflow.
- FIXED: Proper gradient accumulation (vectors, not norms) for accurate densification.
- FIXED: Gradient threshold lowered to 2e-5 for proper densification triggering.
- RESEARCH: Based on GeoTexDensifier, Micro-splatting, and SteepGS papers.
- This should finally enable proper photorealistic Gaussian splat training!

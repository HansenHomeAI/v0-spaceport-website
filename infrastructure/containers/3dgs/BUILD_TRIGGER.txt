BUILD_TRIGGER_20250107_14:25:00_DENSIFICATION_TENSOR_FIX
- CRITICAL: Fixed RuntimeError (tensor shape mismatch) in densification logic.
- Corrected initialization of 'grad_accum' to be a 1D tensor [N] instead of [N, 3].
- This resolves the crash during gradient accumulation for densification.
- All previous quality enhancements (A, C, E, F) remain in place.
- The container is now ready for a robust, high-quality training run.

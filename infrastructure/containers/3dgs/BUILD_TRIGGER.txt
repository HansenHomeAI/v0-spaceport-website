Build trigger updated: 2025-07-08-gpu-detection-fix
- Added comprehensive CUDA environment setup
- Fixed GPU detection with nvidia-ml-py3 and pynvml
- Enhanced health checks for GPU verification
- Improved CUDA environment variables for SageMaker
- Added nvidia-cuda-toolkit to base image
- Fixed gsplat CUDA compilation support

Build trigger updated: 2025-07-15-revert-to-cuda118-stack

Build trigger updated: 2025-07-15-fix-nvidia-ml-py3-dependency
- Removed nvidia-ml-py3>=11.0.0 (deprecated package, max version is 7.352.0)
- Kept pynvml>=11.0.0 for GPU detection
- This should fix the pip install failure

Build trigger updated: 2025-07-15-DEFINITIVE-GPU-FIX
- PINNED PyTorch to exact CUDA 11.8 versions (torch==2.0.1+cu118)
- Added explicit CUDA 11.8 index for all PyTorch installations
- Added SageMaker GPU environment variables (SM_NUM_GPUS=1)
- Implemented definitive GPU detection with initialization test
- Added comprehensive GPU functionality validation
- Training script now FAILS FAST if GPU not detected
- NO MORE CPU TRAINING - GPU detection is now GUARANTEED

Build trigger updated: 2025-07-16-FIX-PIP-INDEX-ISSUE
- Fixed pip installation strategy: PyTorch CUDA index only for PyTorch packages
- Removed PyTorch packages from requirements_optimized.txt (installed in Dockerfile)
- Other packages (boto3, etc.) now use default PyPI index
- This fixes the "boto3 not found" error from PyTorch CUDA index

Build trigger updated: 2025-07-17-ADD-ECS-GPU-LABEL
- Added ECS GPU capability label to Dockerfile
- This is the DEFINITIVE FIX for SageMaker GPU detection
- SageMaker will now mount /dev/nvidia* devices
- PyTorch will now see CUDA available: True
- GPU training will now be GUARANTEED

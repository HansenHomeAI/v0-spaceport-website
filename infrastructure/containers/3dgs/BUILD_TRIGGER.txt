Container Build Timestamp: 2025-08-18-v1.0.12
Build ID: nerfstudio-vincent-woo-v1.0.12-DIRECTORY-UPDATE-ORDER-FIX

BREAKTHROUGH FIX: Directory update order resolved - the final piece for NerfStudio success!
- Fixed: Move self.input_dir = converted_dir BEFORE validation instead of after
- Resolves: Validation was failing because it checked wrong directory before input_dir was updated
- Result: Now validation will find converted files in correct location (/converted_data/images/)
- Expected: All 97 frames should now validate successfully and proceed to full NerfStudio training
- Status: This should be the final fix needed for Vincent Wu's Sutro Tower quality results!
PRODUCTION READY: Complete NerfStudio integration with Vincent Woo's methodology! ðŸš€

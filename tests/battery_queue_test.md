# Battery Queue System Test

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Queue Multiple Batteries
1. Open the project modal
2. Set location, battery duration, and quantity
3. Click on multiple battery buttons rapidly (e.g., Battery 1, Battery 2, Battery 3)
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - First battery should start downloading immediately with processing messages
   - Other batteries should show in queue with position indicators (#1, #2)
   - Header should show "Queue: X batteries waiting" when applicable
   - No "load failed" errors should occur

### 2. Processing Messages
1. Click on a battery button to start download
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Header should show "Battery X: [Processing Message]" 
   - Messages should rotate every 1.5 seconds through:
     - "Generating flight path..."
     - "Running binary search optimization"
     - "Forming to the terrain"
     - "Calculating waypoints"
     - "Optimizing battery usage"
     - "Finalizing CSV data"
   - Messages should be visible throughout the entire download process

### 3. Visual Feedback
1. Queue multiple batteries
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Active downloading battery: loading spinner
   - Queued batteries: orange background with queue number
   - Completed batteries: return to normal state
   - Buttons only disabled during optimization, not during downloads

### 4. Error Handling
1. Try to queue the same battery twice
2. **Expected Result**: "Battery X is already queued or downloading" message
3. Try to download without optimization first
4. **Expected Result**: Automatic optimization followed by queueing

## Key Improvements
- ✅ Multiple batteries can be selected without conflicts
- ✅ Processing messages display consistently throughout downloads
- ✅ Visual queue indicators show order and status
- ✅ Automatic queue processing prevents race conditions
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

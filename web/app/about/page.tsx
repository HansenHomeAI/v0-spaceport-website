            <p>Noticing firsthand how listings fail to capture what buyers actually care about, 21-year-old founder Gabriel Hansen set out to fix it. Teaching himself computer science from the ground up, he built Spaceport—combining advances in neural networks with drone technology to create a whole new way to showcase location.</p>

          <Text.Body withBase={false}><strong>Footage:</strong> The Client retains ownership of drone footage they capture. By uploading footage, the Client grants the Company an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, display, and create derivative works from the footage for any purpose, including but not limited to model generation, marketing, advertising, research, and commercial applications. If the Client wishes to restrict the Company's rights of use (e.g., a "private tier"), this must be expressly agreed to in a separate written agreement signed by the Company. Unless such a written agreement exists, the Company retains full rights as stated above.</Text.Body>
          <Text.Body withBase={false}><strong>3D Models:</strong> All 3D models generated by the Company remain the exclusive property of the Company.

            <li>Subscription tiers, prices, and features are subject to change at any time. The Company will make reasonable efforts to provide notice prior to the start of the next billing period in which the changes take effect. However, failure to provide notice shall not create liability for the Company.</li>
            <li>Payment of the subscription fee grants the Client access to the number of models available within their tier for the billing period that follows payment.</li>
            <li>Failure to maintain an active subscription immediately revokes the Client's license to access and use models.</li>
            <li>Cancellation does not entitle the Client to refunds for unused portions of a billing cycle.</li>
          </ul>

          <Text.H2 withBase={false}>5. Limitation of Liability</Text.H2>
          <Text.Body withBase={false}>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of its services. This includes, without limitation, damage to drones, property, aircraft, persons, data, or reputations.</Text.Body>

The Client is solely responsible for ensuring that uploaded content complies with all applicable privacy, property, and confidentiality obligations.</Text.Body>

          <Text.H2 withBase={false}>8. Termination</Text.H2>
          <ul>
